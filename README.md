# Hi! I’m Isabella 👋

I’m a researcher and analyst with a background in **data-driven policy** and a growing focus on **cybersecurity**, **threat intelligence**, and the security of democratic institutions. I like working where technical methods, national security, and real-world policy decisions intersect.

## What I’m interested in

- Cyber threat intelligence and tracking state and non-state actors
- Election security, information operations, and democratic resilience
- Applied data analysis in Python (scraping, PDF/table extraction, cleaning pipelines)
- Policy for emerging technologies (AI, synthetic biology, dual-use tech)

## My experience:

- **Contract Researcher @ Washington CORE** (2024– )  
  Policy and technology analysis for corporate and government clients, focusing on synthetic DNA regulation, U.S.–China tech decoupling, and federal AI and emerging tech initiatives (DoD, NSF, DoS). Also contribute to Insights pieces on executive orders, infrastructure, energy, and supply-chain risk.

- **Advocacy Intern @ Human Rights Watch** (2025)  
  Supported Washington-based advocacy on U.S. foreign policy, helping brief congressional offices, draft advocacy materials, and track legislation on conflict-affected regions and humanitarian crises.

- **Research roles @ Brown / Watson Institute**  
  - Research Team Leader: designing and testing metrics for electoral fraud, violence, and irregularities using election-monitor data.  
  - Research Assistant: building a cross-national dataset of legal sanctions for electoral infractions in 165+ countries.

- **Intern @ U.S. Embassy in Jakarta (DoS)**  
  Contributed to anti-corruption research and compiled a registry of corruption cases in Indonesia during political transitions, with a focus on data structure and traceability.

These projects sit close to themes in cyber / threat intel: understanding actors, incentives, and systems under stress, and building data pipelines that make those dynamics measurable.

## Current affiliation

- **Brown University** — working on research projects in security, emerging technologies, and data science–driven policy analysis.

## What you’ll find here

- Notebooks and scripts for election data, PDF scraping, and metric design
- Early experiments in cyber / threat‑intel workflows and tooling
- Code from independent studies and collaborations on democracy, security, and emerging tech
